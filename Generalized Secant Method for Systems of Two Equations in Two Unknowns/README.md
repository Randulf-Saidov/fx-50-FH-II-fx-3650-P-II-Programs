# Generalized Secant Method for Systems of Two Equations in Two Unknowns

This program is a simple implementation of the generalized finite difference method for systems of two equations in two unknowns for fx-50 FH II and fx-3650P II.

## Instructions

- Insert the functions $f(x,y)$ and $g(x,y)$ in the specific spots for solving the systems of the two equations $f(x,y)=0$ and $g(x,y)=0$.
- Input the coordinates of three different points in terms of $a+bi$ such that

$$
F(X)=
\begin{pmatrix}
f(X)\\
g(X)
\end{pmatrix}
$$

- is different for each point, or else it will give `MATH ERROR`.

- Press `EXE` until it reaches the desired result or gives `MATH ERROR`.
