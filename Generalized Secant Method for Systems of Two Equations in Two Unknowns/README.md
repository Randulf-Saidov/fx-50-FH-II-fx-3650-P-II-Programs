# Generalized Secant Method for Systems of Two Equations in Two Unknowns

This program is a simple implementation of the generalized finite difference method for systems of two equations in two unknowns for fx-50FH II and fx-3650P II.

## Instructions

- Insert the functions $f(x,y)$ and $g(x,y)$ in the specific spots for solving the system of equations $f(x,y)=0$ and $g(x,y)=0$.
- Input the coordinates of three different points in terms of $a+bi$.
- Press `EXE` until it reaches the desired result or gives `Math ERROR`.
