# Tic-tac-toe

This program is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-tac-toe game for fx-50FH II. The game allows two players to take turns marking `3` and `8` on a 3x3 grid, with the goal of getting three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Instructions

- When the title screen shows up, press `EXE` to start.
- The program will show whose turn it is; enter the coordinates of the cell you want to place your character in according to the 3Ã—3 grid below:
  
  |       | 0 | 1 | 2 |
  |-------|---|---|---|
  | **0** | 2 | 1 | 0 |
  | **1** | 5 | 4 | 3 |
  | **2** | 8 | 7 | 6 |
  
  Player 1 uses `3` while Player 2 uses `8`; `1` represents empty space.

- If the cell is occupied or does not exist, you will be asked for another input.
- If the input is validated, the program will update and display the board.
- The game announces a win or draw at the end.  Press `EXE` to restart.
